            <li>1/2 (28 ounce) spaghetti sauce
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes

                            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (optional)
                             <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (optional)
                                <li>1 teaspoon salt
                                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper
                                         <li>2 cups dried mafalda noodles
                                             <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
                <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
                    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
                        <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </ol>
